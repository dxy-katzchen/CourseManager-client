# üéì Front-end of Course Manager

This is the front-end part of the **Course Manager** system. View the back-end part [here](https://github.com/dxy-katzchen/CourseManager-Server).

‚òÅÔ∏è The project is deployed on AWS EC2. You can access the live site [here](https://courseManager.sabinalovecat.com).

## üìñ Introduction

`CourseManager` is an Instructional Management System (IMS) that enables managing school activities like course enrollment, grade management, and viewing information for students, teachers, and administrators.

## üåü Functionality

The Course Management System has three roles. The following outlines the system's functionality for each role:

### üë©‚Äçüéì Student

- Enroll and withdraw from courses during the enrollment phase.
- View enrolled courses and grades.
- After the course ends, students can evaluate the course (peer review).

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher

- Grade students after the course ends.
- View the list of courses they teach and the enrolled students.

### üõ† Admin

- Add, edit, or delete course information.
- Publish announcements.

### üîß General Functions

- Edit personal homepage.
- Maintain personal information.
- View Student Affairs announcements.
- View all available courses.

## üõ° Non-functional Requirements

### üîê Authorization

Uses **jsonwebtoken** for access control. After login, a token is generated and sent to the front-end with user information. For each request, the front-end must send the token for identity verification. On the back-end, user information is verified to prevent unauthorized access.
Because jwt could be reverse-engineered, I filtered out the sensitive information like password and email from the jwt payload to ensure the security of the system.

### üß™ Validation

Both the front-end and back-end adopt a combined approach for validation to enhance program robustness.

- Front-end uses **element-plus** validation components to ensure data legality before form submission.
- Back-end uses **joi** middleware to validate data types from the front-end, ensuring the integrity of critical processes (like insert and update operations).

For detailed validation rules, refer to the code in the `/schema` directory and documentation.

### üîÑ CAPTCHA

Uses **svg-captcha** for CAPTCHA verification. Upon login, users input the CAPTCHA code displayed as an image. A token is issued after successful validation.

### üîë Encryption

**bcryptjs** is used to hash passwords before storing them in the database. The passwords cannot be reverse-engineered, by using this client-side encryption strategyto ensure that the passwords are secure.

### üö¶ Route Redirection

Routing guards are used. If the back-end detects an invalid or missing token, the user is redirected to the login page.
